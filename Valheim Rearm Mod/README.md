# Valheim Rearm Mod

This is a simple mod that re-equips your left and right items that you had equipped before swimming. No more accidentally throwing punches when you thought you had a weapon equipped during a chase!

This should work with any item that is equipable in your left and right hand.

The goal of this mod was to just provide a QOL update without impacting any meaningful game mechanics, such as being able to fight in water.

## Requirements

If you use Vortex or another mod manager, you need nothing else! Although you'll want to make sure you have the latest BepInEx installed via Vortex.

If you are installing this manually, you'll need [BepInEx Valheim](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/) from Thunderstore.

## Install

- Mod Manager (**recommended**)
  1. Click the `Mod Manager Download` button on the Files tab
- Manual
  1. Download with the `Manual Download` button on the Files tab and extract the files.
  1. Install [BepInEx Valheim](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/) from Thunderstore
  1. Put the ValheimRearmMod.dll in your BepInEx plugin folder

## Reporting Issues

You can report issues here, but it would also be best (and reach me faster) if you put issues on the GitHub repository (linked in the [Source section](#source)) as well.

## Extra

I'm interested in making more mods. If you have ideas for a mod, feel free to message them to me and I might just make it!
